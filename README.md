# FeedR - Feed Reader

After learning that there are people out there that have trouble reading (primarily those who have a hard time focusing on text, or have a hard time scanning through a series of lines of text), I wanted to try my hand at a potential solution. Introducing FeedR, my attempt at helping alleviate that difficulty.

## How to use

The way to use the web app (once it is completed) is simple:

**Option A**: (Requires adding support for websites through the Module Mapping System)
- Find some content online,
- Paste the link into FeedR,
- Press the Play button

**Option B**: Upload a text file for processing.
- Select the 'File' option.
- Browse for your file.
- Press Upload!

**Option C**: Paste the text directly.
- Select the 'Text' option.
- Find some text you want Feedr to read.
- Copy and paste it into the textbox provided.
- Press the Play Button!


## How to build

- `npm i express nodemon dotenv cheerio axios concurrently --save` <- All the dependencies.
- `npm run dev` <- Will start the development server and the react web app.

## Future Plans

- Adding support for file uploading. [Completed]
- Adding support for text copy-paste. [Completed]

## Releases

None at the moment, still have to finalize some things.
