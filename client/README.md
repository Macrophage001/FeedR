# FeedR - Feed Reader

Content Straight To You, Simple

After learning that there are people out there that have trouble reading (primarily those who have a hard time focusing on text, or have a hard time scanning through a series of lines of text), I wanted to try my hand at a potential solution. Introducing FeedR, my attempt at helping alleviate that difficulty.

## How to use

The way to use the web app (once it is completed) is simple:

- Find some content online,
- Paste the link into FeedR,
- Press the Play button,
- Let FeedR do the rest!

## How to build

- `npm i express nodemon dotenv cheerio axios concurrently --save` <- All the dependencies.
- `npm run dev` <- Will start the development server and the react web app.

## Future Plans

- Adding support for file uploading as well.

## Releases

None at the moment, still have to finalize some things.
